# PicoCTF2017
This repository contains my solutions for PicoCTF2017 challanges.
They are either in the form of a step by step guide how to solve it or as a solution.sh script which prints out the flag.
Some challanges are required to be done on the shell2017 server via ssh. In that case use:
``` sh
../../ssh.sh | solution.sh
```
